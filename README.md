# Hourly_Energy_Consumption_Prediction_using_LSTM
 AEP_hourly dataset from kaggle is used to predict the hourly energy consumption(24 datapoints) providing data of n(hyperparameter) prior days.<br>
 Dataset is provided in the repository. Dataset has been downloaded from kaggle competition - https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption<br>
 I have used LSTM to make prediction from the prior data.<br>
 Notebook is written in a self explanatory manner.<br>
